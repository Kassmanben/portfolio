<div><p class="card-text">Frustration occurs when a person is blocked from a desired outcome. It is not necessarily a bad
  thingâ€“ especially when it becomes a motivator for productive changes. However, when frustration
  results in anger, irritability, stress, resentment or giving up, it can be destructive. Frustration can
  turn a positive person into somebody who sees most things as problems. It can be immobilizing or
  may even cause you to think and act irrationally.</p>
