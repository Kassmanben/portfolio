  <p class="card-text">Approximately 19% of adults and 32% of adolescents in the U.S. have been diagnosed with some
    form of an anxiety disorder (including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Chronic Worry, Social Anxiety,
    Panic Disorder, OCD & phobias). When you live with anxiety, it can feel like you're the only one who
    struggles with it at times. I want to remind you that you are not alone and that it is highly treatable
    and manageable.</p>
