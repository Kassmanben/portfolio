  <p>Approximately 19% of adults and 32% of adolescents in the U.S. have been diagnosed with some
    form of an anxiety disorder (including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Chronic Worry, Social Anxiety,
    Panic Disorder, OCD & phobias). When you live with anxiety, it can feel like you're the only one who
    struggles with it at times. I want to remind you that you are not alone and that it is highly treatable
    and manageable.</p>
  <p>Anxiety is more than just being "too worried" or "high strung." It goes beyond learning to breathe
    deeply or avoiding certain triggers. Well-meaning friends or family might attempt to ‘help’ by
    saying things like, “Just don’t think about it so much,” or “Everyone gets nervous. You’ll get over it.”
    Such naïve comments minimize someone’s very real experiences with anxiety and can lead them to
    feel guilty, inept or more isolated; they can lead to them staying stuck rather than moving forward
    with support.</p>
  <p>While everyone experiences anxiety, some feel it more often or more deeply. Your own experience
    of anxiety will depend on:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Genetics</b>—how your parents & other relatives experienced anxiety</li>
    <li><b>Brain chemistry</b>—the type, amount & movement of the chemicals working in your brain</li>
    <li><b>Life events</b>—the situations you are faced with in your life</li>
    <li><b>Personality</b>—how you look at & interpret things that happen to you</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="lighter">* It's likely a combination of all factors that influence levels of anxiety</p>

  <p><b>IF YOU ARE UNSURE YOU EXPERIENCE ANXIETY, ASK:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do you spend large periods of the day worrying?</li>
    <li>Do you often feel nervous, apprehensive or on edge?</li>
    <li>Do you frequently believe others judge you negatively?</li>
    <li>Do you feel like things are getting the better of you?</li>
    <li>Do you find it hard to relax and 'switch off'?</li>
    <li>Do you often imagine the worse case scenario?</li>
    <li>Do you avoid doing things you like because of worries or fears?</li>
    <li>Do you often experience unpleasant physical sensations such as an upset stomach, muscular
      tension, racing heart, dizziness or breathlessness?
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you answer ‘yes’ to any of these, you may be experiencing symptoms of anxiety.</p>
  <b>WHAT CAN YOU DO?</b>
  <p>There are a number of strategies used to reduce anxiety.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Understand more about your type of anxiety</li>
    <li>Learn how to challenge unhelpful thought patterns</li>
    <li> Work on problem solving skills</li>
    <li>Gain tools to reduce the amount of time spent worrying</li>
    <li>Learn relaxation & mindfulness approaches (physically & mentally)</li>
    <li>Learn to realistically assess situations so you avoid them less</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The National Institute of Mental Health reports that 86% of people with anxiety disorders either do
    not seek treatment, or use treatments that are inadequate for stopping anxiety. If you, or someone
    you know, live with anxiety - get information & talk to a professional to create a treatment plan.</p>
