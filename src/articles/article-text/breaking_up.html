  <p>Nobody likes goodbyes. Ending a romantic relationship, no matter how long you’ve been together
    with someone, is painful. At times it can be hard to imagine that you'll ever feel better.</p>
  <p>Being in relationship with a partner involves having that person become a regular part of your daily
    life. Together you make decisions such as: What do we want to eat? How should we spend our free
    time? What do we see in our future together? When the relationship ends, you become painfully
    aware of just how much the two of you shared, and how strange it feels to go back to making
    decisions just for yourself.</p>
  <p>After some time together, couples begin to define themselves in terms of the relationship. Your
    identity relies heavily on your attachment to your partner. When a couple splits, many individuals
    indulge in self-critical thoughts - questioning if there is something “wrong” with them, whether they
    will ever find love again, or if they can survive on their own. Rarely are these critical thoughts based
    in reality.</p>
  <b>REMEMBER</b> that you:
  <ul>
    <li>may feel pain or sadness or anger or confusion (or all of these)</li>
    <li>may feel lonely but your are not alone</li>
    <li>are loved by others</li>
    <li>will survive this</li>
  </ul>
  <b>WORK ON</b> accepting that:
  <ul>
    <li>the relationship has ended – denial only prolongs the pain</li>
    <li>the relationship had gifts as well as challenges</li>
  </ul>
  <b>REALIZE</b> that:
  <ul>
    <li>much of the pain is about the future you imagined together</li>
    <li>as you honor the grief and heal, the pain will subside</li>
    <li>holding on to emotions attached to an ex will keep you stuck</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You are a whole person on your own. No person can complete you. You're not losing your identity
    by losing the relationship. You may even be opening up a door to get to know yourself better.</p>
  <b>TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Take time for yourself & respect your feelings</li>
    <li>Don't isolate yourself. Reach out for support. There is no reason to go through this alone</li>
    <li>Be careful with your use of alcohol, food & medications – do not use them to “cope”</li>
    <li>Exercise & move - exercise releases endorphins - the "feel-good" hormones</li>
    <li>Take time BEFORE making any major decisions -make sure you're not just creating a distraction</li>
    <li>Acknowledge that things will be different</li>
    <li>Moving forward is the ultimate end goal. Be careful to not stay stuck in the negative, or in over-
      analyzing the situation. This can impede healing
    </li>
    <li>Understand the difference between grieving and “not letting go”. It is a fine line.</li>
  </ul>
