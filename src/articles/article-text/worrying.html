<p>Most of us worry about things pretty regularly. This can be useful in situations like getting ready for
  a test or taking a trip, or preparing for an interview. However, when worrying becomes
  unproductive or difficult to control, it can spiral out of control without warning.</p>
<p>In any given week, I work with clients who worry about a wide range of things. The most common
  MAJOR worries cover areas such life events as relationships, finances, work and health. And then
  there are what we consider “daily hassles”… things that occur on a regular basis and cause severe
  bouts of stress.</p>
<p>Common DAILY worries include: not enough sleep, losing something important, traffic, problems
  with technology, forgetting a date or task, personal appearance and basic time management. And
  because these worries happen on a nearly daily basis, or sometimes even several times within the
  same day, they overwhelm people to the point of feeling helpless or “under water”.</p>
<p>When the worrying gives rise to extreme stress or anxiety that borders on obsessive thinking, it is
  no longer productive and can quickly become incapacitating. This is an indicator that it’s time to
  make changes.</p>
<p><b>STEPS TO TAKE</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Distraction</b> – find something else to focus on for a bit. Positive distractions that can be done
    several times a day include: word or logic puzzles, studying, writing, coloring or reading.
  </li>
  <li><b>Get Physical</b> – exercise or physical movement helps break the obsessive cycle of worry. This might
    be outdoor or indoor exercise, dancing, walking, or even household chores.
  </li>
  <li><b>Engage the Senses</b> – use sight, hearing, touch & taste to take a break and be present. This could
    include: a movie, limited video gaming, gardening, cooking, reading, photography, making some art
    or listening to music.
  </li>
  <li><b>Breathe</b> – take a minute to breathe from your abdomen or the bottom of your lungs. Breathing
    deeply counteracts the typically shallow breathing that occurs with stress or worry. Practice this 5-
    10 minutes until you feel relaxed and freer from obsessive thoughts.
  </li>
  <li><b>Get Rational</b> – be realistic about what you can and cannot do-- about what is and is not your
    obligation or duty to correct, change or control. yourself some slack.
  </li>
  <li><b>Get out of Your Head</b> - focus less on your mental chatter and more on what you can actually do
    something about. Prioritize when you can. Let go of unimportant or unchangeable things.
  </li>
  <li><b>Talk it Out</b> – there's no need to be alone in your worry. Find someone to either talk about anything
    BUT your worries, or someone to help you manage the worries…or in the very least, will listen to
    how you are feeling and offer support. Gain perspective from someone on the outside of the stress
    or worries.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Chronic worriers believe they can’t control their thoughts. The fact is that you can learn to control
  how often & when you worry – through practice. Set aside time (10-15 minutes) each day to
  consider worries and avoiding thinking about them at other times in the day, using tool above.</p>
