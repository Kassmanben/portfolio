<p>Every day, when you go out into the world, you impact people whether you think you do or not.
  Some days, you spend hours supporting or caring for another person. Many days, maybe more than
  you are willing to admit – you forget to focus your attention on caring for yourself.</p>
<p>"Self-care" is a frequently used buzzword and yet, many people don’t really know what it means.
  Self-care is any activity that you do to intentionally take care of your mental, emotional & physical
  health and needs. And it is often overlooked. It is not something that you force yourself to do, or do
  out of obligation. It is anything but a one-time act. It is a mindset and a regular practice.</p>
<p><b>SELF-CARE STEPS TO TRY</b></p>
