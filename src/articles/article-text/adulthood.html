<p>With all the recent graduates from high school eager to jump into life as adults, we cannot ignore
  the facts that a large percentage of young people know very little about how being a grown-up
  works. Being academically prepared is not the same as having real-life skills and knowledge.</p>
<p><b>STEPS TOWARD ADULT INDEPENDENCE</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> Can you make an important decision on your own? Figuring out how to manage your own life
    involves a LOT of making decisions without the input of others. Learn to tap into your own values &
    beliefs to help you make the best choices.
  </li>
  <li> Do you have a good understanding of money? Not just how to spend, but how to save, how to
    budget. Issues like credit, interest, debt, taxes, etc.?
  </li>
  <li> Are you resourceful? Being an adult requires solving a lot of new problems...sometimes daily. You
    cannot always rely on someone else fixing or solving them for you. Use your intelligence, be
    creative, build resources & work hard to come up with your resolutions. It's very empowering!
  </li>
  <li> How do you handle being sick? Learn about self-care, when & how to get medical attention, and do
    not ignore things when you do not feel well.
  </li>
  <li> Can you wake up on your own, before noon? Most adult responsibilities (college, jobs, business
    transactions, etc.) happen between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. Take advantage of a FULL day by
    being awake for it!
  </li>
  <li> Are you polite? I'm amazed how many people do not use "please" on a regular basis. Take a few
    seconds to appreciate others: hold open a door, say thank you (in person, by phone, text, email,
    letter) when someone helps you out and remember the world does not revolve around you.
  </li>
  <li> Do you know how to make more than cereal or ramen? Learn to feed yourself a well-balanced
    meal...even if it means planning the night before, packing a lunch or making sure you have
    ingredients.
  </li>
  <li> How is your communication? While a lot can be handled by text, learn to actually talk to someone
    on the phone. It's also important to realize that many adults use email to communicate (especially
    busy people like professors & bosses, co-workers & professionals). If someone calls, texts or emails
    you...respond to them! Just reading the message is not enough (this includes, parents, other adults
    and even friends!).
  </li>
  <li> Are you aware of what is happening around you? Check out the news (local, national & global).
    There's a lot going on and it definitely affects you! It also prompts you to remember that others are
    often going through much more than you are. Take interest outside yourself!
  </li>
  <li> And finally, some general basics key to being an adult
    <ul>
      <li> Shower/bathe regularly</li>
      <li>Keep up on your laundry</li>
      <li>Clean up after yourself (in ALL rooms you use!)</li>
      <li>Get enough sleep</li>
      <li>Don't overindulge...in anything!</li>
      <li>Find the balance between work & play - there's time</li>
      <li>Spend less on fast food, fancy coffee, "toys" & partying</li>
      <li>Set realistic goals & take action toward achieving them</li>
      <li>Learn to be assertive (instead of aggressive or passive)</li>
      <li>Be willing to work hard for what you want (grades, jobs, internships, friends, a romantic
        relationship, etc.)
      </li>
      <li>Be accountable for your behaviors, thoughts & emotions</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>Being an adult is actually pretty great - but you need to put in the effort to make it worthwhile!</p>
